# The Satoshi Standard â‚¿

A simple web app that helps you understand the value of things in Bitcoin Satoshis.

## What it does
This project was built to practice working with external APIs, handling user input, and creating a responsive design. The main idea is to change your perspective on money by pricing everyday items in "sats" (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) instead of your local currency.

## Features
- Real-time Price Conversion: Enter any item and its price to see its value in Satoshis instantly.

- Save Your Items: Add items to a personal list to keep track of their value.

- Local Storage: Your list is saved in your browser, so it's still there when you come back.

- Price History: Compare an item's current price in sats to what it was 30 days ago.

- Totals View: See the total value of your saved items in both sats and your local currency.

- Responsive Design: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: React (with Vite)

- Styling: Tailwind CSS

- API: CoinGecko API for Bitcoin price data.

- Testing: Vitest & React Testing Library
